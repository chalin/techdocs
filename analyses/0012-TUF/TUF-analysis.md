## Introduction

This document analyzes the effectiveness and completeness of 
[The Update Framework](https://theupdateframework.io) (TUF) open source software (OSS) project's documentation
and website. It is funded by the CNCF Foundation as part of its overall effort
to incubate, grow, and graduate open source cloud native software projects.

According to CNCF best practices guidelines, effective documentation is a
prerequisite for program graduation. The documentation analysis is the first
step of a CNCF process aimed at assisting projects with their documentation
efforts.

### Purpose

This document analyzes the current state of **The Update Framework (TUF)**
documentation. It provides project leaders with an informed understanding
of potential problems in current project documentation. A second [TUF-impementation.md](./TUF-implementation.md)
document, , outlines an actionable plan for improvement. A third document, the 
[TUF-issues.md](./TUF-issues.md) outlines issues to be added to the project documentation repository. These
issues can be taken up by contributors to improve the documentation.

This document:

- Analyzes the current TUF technical documentation and website
- Compares existing documentation against the CNCFâ€™s standards
- Recommends a program of key improvements with the largest return on investment

### Scope of analysis

The documentation includes the entire contents of the website,
the technical documentation, and documentation for contributors and users on the TUF GitHub repository.

The TUF website and documentation are written in Markdown and compiled using the Hugo static site generator and served on the Netlify platform. The site's code is stored on the TUF GitHub
repo.

#### In scope

- Website: https://theupdateframework.io
- Documentation: https://theupdateframework.io/content
- Website configuration(Hugo): https://github.com/theupdateframework/theupdateframework.io


#### Out of scope

- The TUF community repository: https://github.com/theupdateframework/community
- TUF specification repository: https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification
- Python reference implementaion reposiroty: https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf
- TUF Augmentation proposals respsitory: https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps
- TUF artwork repository: https://github.com/theupdateframework/artwork


### How this document is organized

This document is divided into three sections that represent three major areas of
concern:

- **Project documentation:** Analyzes documentation for users of the TUF project
  software.
- **Contributor documentation:** Analyzes documentation for existing and new contributors to TUF project.
- **Website:** Analyzes the mechanics of publishing the documentation, including branding, website structure, and maintainability.

Each section begins with summary ratings based on a rubric with appropriate
[criteria] for the section, then proceeds to:

- **Comments**: Observations about the existing documentation, with a focus on
  how it does or does not help TUF project users achieve their goals.
- **Recommendations**: Suggested changes that would improve the effectiveness of
  the documentation.

The accompanying [implementation](./TUF-implementation.md) document breaks the recommendations down into
concrete actions that can be implemented by project contributors. Its focus is
on drilling down to specific, achievable work that can be completed in
constrained blocks of time. 

Ultimately, the implementation items are decomposed
into a series of [issues](./TUF-issues.md) that can be implemented by the project maintainers.

### How to use this document

Readers interested only in actionable improvements should skip this document and
read the **[implementation](./TUF-implementation.md) plan** and **[issues](./TUF-issues.md) list**.

Readers interested in the current state of the documentation and the reasoning
behind the recommendations should read the section of this document pertaining
to their area of concern:

- [Project documentation]()
- [Contributor documentation]()
- [Website and documentation infrastructure]()


#### Recommendations, requirements, and best practices

This analysis measures documentation against CNCF project maturity standards,
and suggests possible improvements. In most cases there is more than one way to
do things. Few recommendations here are meant to be prescriptive. Rather, the
recommended implementations represent the reviewers' experience with how to
apply documentation best practices. In other words, borrowing terminology from
the lexicon of [RFCs][rfc-spec], the changes described here should be understood
as "recommended" or "should" at the strongest, and "optional" or "may" in many
cases. Any "must" or "required" actions are clearly denoted as such, and pertain
to legal requirements such as copyright and licensing issues.

## Project documentation


| Criteria                  | Rating (1-5) |
| -------------------------- | -------------- |
| Information architecture   | 3 |
| New user content           | 1 |
| Content maintainability    | 3 |
| Content creation processes | 1 |
| Inclusive language         | 3 |

Scale:

- 1 = (Is not present)
- 3 = (Is present, but needs improvement)
- 5 = (Is executed extremely well or no improvement required)

### Comments
The following sections contain brief assessments of each element of the Project
Documentation rubric.

#### Information architecture

- There is an overview section explaining what TUF is and its use cases. The features, the metadata and roles are well explained with examples for each metadata.

- No tutorials for specific feature implementation. But, there are videos explaining various use cases.
